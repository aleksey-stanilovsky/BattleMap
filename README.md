# BattleMap

## Description
BattleMap is a project that is an interactive map for fighting in roleâ€”playing games. The project allows users to create and manage maps of battle arenas, place units on them, and visualize the course of the battle.

## Functionality
- Create and edit battle arena maps.
- Placement and management of units on the map.
- Visualization of the course of the battle and the movement of units.

## Technologies
The project was developed using the following technologies:
- C++ 20

## Running Requirements

For the application to function correctly, a `script.txt` file is necessary, which should be located in a any directory. This file is essential for defining the initial setup and actions within the BattleMap application, adhering to a specific command and argument structure for game initialization and unit management.

Please ensure that the `script.txt` file is available and you have **passed path to it as an argument** to an executable before launching the application.

### Format of `script.txt`

The file follows a command-based structure where each line represents an action to be taken within the game environment:

- **CREATE_MAP [width] [height]**: Initializes the game map with the specified dimensions. **This command can only appear once and must be at the beginning of the file**.
- **SPAWN_WARRIOR [id] [x] [y] [hp] [strength]**: Places a warrior unit on the map at the specified coordinates with the defined health and strength.
- **SPAWN_ARCHER [id] [x] [y] [hp] [strength] [range] [agility]**: Places an archer unit on the map at the specified coordinates with defined health, strength, range, and agility attributes.
- **MARCH [unit_id] [x] [y]**: Commands a unit to move to the specified coordinates.
- **WAIT [ticks]**: Pauses the execution of subsequent commands for a specified number of ticks.

### Example of `script.txt` Content

```plaintext
CREATE_MAP 30 30
SPAWN_WARRIOR 1 2 3 15 5
SPAWN_ARCHER 3 19 20 10 2 2 3
SPAWN_ARCHER 2 13 23 10 2 2 3
MARCH 1 11 21
WAIT 10
MARCH 3 14 24
WAIT 10
```

### Launching the Application with `script.txt`

To launch the application using the `script.txt` file, ensure that the file is located in [specify location]. Then, execute the following command:

```bash
./BattleMap ../scenario.txt
```

## Installation and launch
To use the project, you need to clone the repository and build the project using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleksey-stanilovsky/BattleMap.git
cd BattleMap
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
cmake --build . --config Release
```
